# Weave

Weave is a small open-source library for rendering using WebGL built from scratch. It contains similar functionality to THREE.js, handling shading, cameras, and lighting. To use this library in another project just copy the weave.esm.js. To rebuild the project do the follow

 ```bash
   npm install
   ```

 ```bash
   npx rollup --config      
   ```
